Welcome to my academic website! I am Clara Dragut, a researcher specializing in computational linguistics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions for natural language processing tasks, with a particular interest in low-resource languages.

## Research Interests

- **Computational Linguistics**: Exploring algorithms and models that enable machines to understand and generate human language.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying statistical methods to teach computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Developing mathematical models to represent complex linguistic phenomena and inform decision-making processes.

## Current Projects

### Dynamic In-Context Learning for Prakrit

Investigating example selection strategies, such as TF-IDF and NMF, using SBERT and BLEU scores to enhance translation accuracy for low-resource languages like Prakrit.
